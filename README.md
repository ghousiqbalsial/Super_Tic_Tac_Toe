# Super Tic Tac Toe

This is a Python implementation of the Super Tic Tac Toe game using Pygame.

The game was inspired by a [Vsauce video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_Na3a1ZrX7c).

## Rules of Super Tic Tac Toe

Super Tic Tac Toe is a variant of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. It consists of a grid of smaller Tic Tac Toe boards, and the objective remains the same - to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) within each smaller board. However, the twist lies in the gameplay:

1. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in a smaller board.
2. The position of the opponent's move within the smaller board determines which larger board the next player must play in.
3. The game is won by getting three marks in a row in any of the larger boards.

## Installation

Before running the game, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the Pygame library.

Intall pygame by running:

```bash
 pip install pygame.
```

You can play the game by running the following in the directory of the game:

```bash
python3 super_tic_tac_toe.py
```
